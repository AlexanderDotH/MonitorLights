# MonitorLights

Because buying a lamp is apparently too mainstream 💡

Turn your expensive gaming monitors into the world's most overqualified light bulbs! Why spend $10 on a desk lamp when you can use your $500 monitor array to illuminate your midnight snack sessions?

### Features
- ✨ Transforms your PC monitors into ambient lighting
- 🍕 Perfect for eating in the dark while binge-watching (no more stabbing your hand with a fork)
- 💸 Finally justify that triple monitor setup to your significant other
- 🌈 Customizable brightness (from "romantic dinner" to "interrogation room")
- ⚡ Uses approximately 300% more electricity than a regular bulb (but who's counting?)
- 👻 Disappears without a trace when you're done (unlike your browser history)

### How It Works

1. Click "Light me up!" - Choose which monitor deserves to become a glorified flashlight

2. Adjust the brightness slider - Find that sweet spot between "can see my food" and "retina damage"

3. Click the light window to dismiss - Poof! Gone without a trace, like it never happened

4. Repeat - Because one monitor-lamp is never enough

### System Requirements

- OS: Windows (tested on Windows 11)
- Monitors: At least 1 (preferably 3+ to truly commit to the bit)
